In my previous post, I wrote about how someone "<a href="https://fontawesome.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Get Started with Font Awesome Icons</a>" and now simple how you can create a social media icons with Font Awesome. In this post I would like to share my social icons sidebar where you can check my code.

I have used few of social icons as you can see: <em>Facebook</em>, <em>Twitter</em>, <em>Youtube</em>, <em>Google+</em> and <em>LinkedIn</em>. Also I have set the icons sidebar with fixed position, that means it would always be visible to the user even scrolling website.

As you can see below:
