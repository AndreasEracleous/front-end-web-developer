I worked on a Bootstrap project, where I had to implement Youtube video on Twitter Bootstrap Modal component.

when I pressed to open the Modal component for playing the video, I noticed something weird on it since after Bootstrap Modal has closed.

I realised that the Youtube video has continue playing on the background even when it was closed. I had tried many ways to fix it but at the end I found a solution with JavaScript on how I can stop a Youtube video to still playing on the background and below you can see my solution.
<h2>JavaScript Code for Twitter Bootstrap Modal stop Youtube video</h2>
I used the Modal event function "<strong>hidden.bs.modal</strong>" as they mentioned in their documentation in which it starts to execute when the modal has finished being hidden from the user. What I did I remove and set the video URL in iFrame again when it has been closed the Modal. In this way it terminate the procedure of the video as a result to make it to stop.
 
<pre lang="lang">$('#youtubeVideo').on('hidden.bs.modal', function() {
    var $this = $(this).find('iframe'),
      tempSrc = $this.attr('src');
    $this.attr('src', "");
    $this.attr('src', tempSrc);
  });</pre> 

<h2>JavaScript Code for Twitter Bootstrap Modal stop HTML5 video</h2>
 
<pre lang="lang">$('#html5Video').on('hidden.bs.modal', function() {
    var html5Video = document.getElementById("htmlVideo");
    if (html5Video != null) {
      html5Video.pause();
      html5Video.currentTime = 0;
    }
  });</pre>
